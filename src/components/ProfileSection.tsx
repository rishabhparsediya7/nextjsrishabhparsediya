          Hi there ðŸ‘‹ <br /> Iâ€™m a Full Stack Developer with 3+ years of
          experience building scalable and user-friendly digital products. I
          enjoy working across the stack â€” from crafting seamless front-end
          experiences with React and React Native, to designing robust back-end
          systems with Node.js, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
          My focus is on writing clean, maintainable, and performant code while
          solving real-world problems. Iâ€™m especially passionate about building
          products that make peopleâ€™s lives easier.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
          Outside of coding, I love exploring new technologies, learning
          continuously, and sharing knowledge with the developer community.
        </p>
